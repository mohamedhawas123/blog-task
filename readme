# API FOR LOGIN AND REGISTER AND BLOG CRUD

This is a basic implementation of a Blog REST API that allows users to register, login, create posts, list all posts, edit their own posts, and delete their own posts. The API is built using Express.js, MongoDB as the database, password encryption for security, and input validation for data integrity.
